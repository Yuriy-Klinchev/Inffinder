Hello everybody!

I started to study Django.
Made some tables. I transferred the data to HTML and then to JS. In JS I do small calculations and return the result to HTML. Now I am creating a table that will store information on service companies and I plan to display the result in HTML and filter it at the request of users. The table has several columns, many of which include duplicate information. Therefore, they will make small tables that I want to include in the main table. Something is not working out yet.
